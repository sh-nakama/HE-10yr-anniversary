# HE-10yr-anniversary
First time waterfall plots using numbers reported from Hawaii Energy's annual reports and internal aggregates.  
Notes: 
- Hawaii Energy's program years run from July 1st to June 30th
- The program became a third party administered efficiency program under contract with the Hawaii PUC in 2009
- The numbers reported don't coincide with actual occured savings since these are reported and incentivized after-the-fact, in batches
- The "main bar" for each year is the average for the program year
